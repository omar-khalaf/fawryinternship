Linux questions:

1- architecture of linux:
		Its composed of 4 layers kernels system admin, system , hardware and shell utility 

2-linux directory structure:
		Its like a tree from and organization of files into a hierarchy of folders and the base of it is root.
3-file management finding files and  directory:
		In linux there is file management system    that manages all files and directory, some of the commands are pwd, cd, ls, cat, mv, cp, mkdir, rmdir, rm, find and locate.
		To find a file or directory u should use find command ,u can search for them by multiple ways, size, date, permission, name and extinction.
4-check users information:
		First use  user command to list all the users, to find a specific one and modify his/her information there multiple commands to that like id, finger command, gatent and much more.   
5-check system information:
		For the software information we can use uname command followed up with - litter for different outputs 
		For the hardware information we can use lshw and if u want a specific info u can follow it up with shorts or html and ect
6-manage system process:
		U can use the top or ps command to track the running process 
		To stop the process u can use the kill command 
		To start the process and give a nice value use nice command and to modify it u can use the renice command.
7-managing groups and users:
		Mange users:
			User account info is stored in ect/passwd, to add user use useradd -c  "user name" account_name,  too remove the user userdel -r account_name, to modify the user use usermod command
		Manage groups: 
			groups account info is stored in ect/group, 
			To add group groupadd
			To change the group mood grouopmod
			To delete the group groupdel
			To add user to the group  sudo usermod -g user group user01
			To remove user from the group gpasswd -d user_name  group_name
8-managing permissions configure and trouble shot:
		First we need to reed and understand the current permissions, and the permissions associated with the user owner, group and others, the permissions comes in two ways symbolic (reed , write , execute) or  octal (4 is reed , 2 is write , 1 is execute ).
		We can give and change permissions with chmod command.
9-network managing partitions:
		For network management it’s a set of tools for configuring the network devices in the linux machine, it can configure be configured manually or automatically. We can use some commands to utilizes the configuration such as ifconfig, ifup, ifdown, ifquery, ethtool and much more.
		For the partitions its essential in OS installation, so we can mange with two base tool GUI tool and CLI tool. Personally I prefer CLI because of its more secure , more recourses and it give wider variety of commands to optimize the partition from cfdsik and fdsik.
10-logical volumes management:
		LVM creates a layer of abstraction over physical storage which helps us helps to create logical storage volumes, advantages of LVM is fives flexible capacity, resizable storage volume, online data relocation and much more.
		(physical volume: it’s a partition or whole disk designated for LVM use) 
		(volume group: is a collection of  PV which creates a pool of disk space out of which LV can be allocated)
		(logical volume: its virtual block storage device that file system, data base or application can use)
11-RPM and software repo manage logging:
RPM is a method of installing, removing, and keeping track of software update from a specific repo ![image](https://github.com/omar-khalaf/fawryinternship/assets/61017583/29e37e8d-8d5a-4640-8ee1-7b82cd375a6a)
