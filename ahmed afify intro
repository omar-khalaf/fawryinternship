# Intro to Devops


DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.[1] DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.

#  Orchestration vs Automation
Automation refers to automating a single process or a small number of related tasks (e.g., deploying an app). Orchestration refers to managing multiple automated tasks to create a dynamic workflow (e.g., deploying an app, connecting it to a network, and integrating it with other systems).

Whereas automation is a simple "if this, then that" process, orchestration has many moving parts and requires advanced logic that can:

The line between the two concepts can be blurry. For example, you can have a process with 100 steps and automate all of them, and you would still rely on automation. You only start orchestrating when you introduce some coordination and decision-making to the process.

Technically, automation is a subset of orchestration as you cannot orchestrate manual, non-automated tasks.

Automation and orchestration do not aim to replace people fully. As a company becomes more reliant on automated tasks, human involvement becomes less frequent but more valuable. The IT staff gets to focus on problem-solving and innovation rather than mundane, day-to-day tasks.

## Cloud computing
 Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.

Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it.

Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses for a number of reasons including cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security.
